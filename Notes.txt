Common coding pitfals:
    1.  Prefix calculator properties with 'calculator.'  Ex: lastResult is incorrect, calculator.lastResult is correct.

Bugs list:

1.      a. Open the calculator
        b. Type in a random LETTER combination
        c. Click AC button
        d. An error is shown.  This should not happen

        Suspected problem:
          When pressing AC, the calculator tries to first 
          perfirm the last operation.  The correct behaviour
          would be to simply clear the inputs without performing
          any calculation. 

        BUG FIXED

2.      a. Open the calculator
        b. Input a valid vector
        c. Click any operator except |v|
        d. Input a valid vector
        e. Click AC.  An answer is calculated.  This should not happen

        Suspected problem:
          When pressing AC, the calculator tries to first 
          perfirm the last operation.  The correct behaviour
          would be to simply clear the inputs without performing
          any calculation. 

        BUG FIXED

3.      a. Open the calculator
        b. Input a valid vector
        c. Click av operator
        d. Click any other operator.  The input field only allows one input.  This should not happen

        BUG FIXED

4.      Calculator clears inputs after an error message is shown. 
        This should not happen.

        BUG FIXED


Update 1.1.0 feature plan:
   -Ability to set to rad/deg mode                                      (done)
   -Ability to set rounding decimal level                               (done)
   -Click on outputs to copy them to the input field                    (done)
   -Control over window keep on top mode                                (done)
   -Info spot (version, creator, etc)                                   (done)
   -Save user preferences when calculator is closed                     (done)
   -More understandable error messages.  Perhaps under categories       (done)
   -Updated app icon (probably will just outline the current icon)      (canceled, due to outlined icon causing grainyness around edges when in title bar)
   -Update EULA (could use Microsoft EULA as template)                  (done)
   -fix known bugs                                                      (done)

   Debating features:
        -Should a release notes spot be added?  I dont think so, because updates are infrequent
        -Custom title bar (may be a waste of time)
        -Vector file import/export (this sounds really dumb)
        -Send feedback section (how would this be implemented?)
        -Save output on close for next time
